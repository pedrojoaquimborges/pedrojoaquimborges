Jo\u00e3o sent it to me back on the early stages of the record and had it looped on the DAW, not being sure what to do with it. It had this fantastic feel, drum mix and was just really banging in general. As a sidenote, I actually think he put this track together being told-off as not being much of a riff-type composer.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I re-recorded the main guitar riff and rearranged some of it to get a more percussive and funky character, and played around with the drum parts and vocal lines to aid him in finding the song\u2019s verse. I also later ended up also doing distorted guitar on the closing track \u201cBem\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more info on the mixing process, check my write-up on the whole record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"fw-600\"><li>Co-production, Guitar, Mixing and Mastering<\/li><li>Released in 2020<\/li><li>Independent Release (now signed to Warner Music Portugal)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jo\u00e3o Borsch - Boca Cheia\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NgQnAUfqI5s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Boca Cheia is the riff and drums driven second single off of Uma Noite Rom\u00e2ntica com Jo\u00e3o Borsch.
