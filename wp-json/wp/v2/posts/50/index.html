First, achieving a striking, impactful aesthetic without losing any of the overwhelming production\/composition detail.

And lastly, getting comfortable getting out of the &#8220;Mixing chair&#8221; every now and then to revisit production details and re-record parts. These hurdles resulted in a process whose main trait was the ability to embrace a recording environment&#8217;s sonic character and signature \u2013 even if said recording space is actually a group of totally distinct untreatead rooms and locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"fw-700 mb-5\"><li>Mixing and Mastering<\/li><li>Released January 2021<\/li><li>Independent Release (currently signed to Warner Music Portugal)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jo\u00e3o Borsch - Uma Noite Rom\u00e2ntica com Jo\u00e3o Borsch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xDgeHeLZtGA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">THE NERDY PARTS:<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this record might have retaught me how to mix mids. And to fully explain that flashy statement, I need to go back in time a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo\u00e3o composed and laid down his tracks for much of the album in the same music room where we started writing, producing and mixing music sometime in 2009. Growing up we were super into rock, metal, electronic dance music and generally loud, banging music (google exercium on bandcamp to visit our early teen angst). Those genres and stylistic tropes informed much of the early ideas on what sounds good and what the goal of shaping a given sound is \u2013 and they definitely have a tendency to thrive on fat drums and thick bass\/guitars\/synths, rather than meticulously orchestrated arrangements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting that this ended up being the record that demanded me to rethink how I looked at all the non-obvious sounds and instruments. Since then, Jo\u00e3o has been through the academic perspectives on music and, generally, just playing\/writing in much more varied genres. Thus, now his music appears to extend itself along three vectors. Firstly, a pop \u201cBLASTING Queen on the hi-fi\u201d type of ecstatic energy, then the colorful melodic\/harmonic structures, and lastly the edge that noisy genres typically bring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to approach the mix for this work, a fat, punchy, in-your-face mix would be insufficient in regards to respecting the actual compositions. Every time I&#8217;d find myself working a snare a bit too much, it could mean losing the highlight on some spicy passing chord. And mids are where all lies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mixing process was slow, to a point where it was probably excruciating for Jo\u00e3o. Not only did we have to revisit production and recording a few times for parts that totally need to be rerecorded or rethought, at the time I wasn\u2019t doing music full-time, but juggling it with having a food business. On the flip side, that allowed for so much learning time for Jo\u00e3o, that he started the process doing \u201calright\u201d recordings and evolved, at the end, to sending over tracks that pretty much mix themselves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uma Noite Rom\u00e2ntica com Jo\u00e3o Borsch is a full-length, vivid tour of Jo\u00e3o\u2019s experience as a listener.
